> Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,  
> Enwrought with golden and silver light,  
>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths  
>Of night and light and the half-light,  
>I would spread the cloths under your feet:  
>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;  
>I have spread my dreams under your feet;  
>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.  

>William Butler Yeats **He Wishes For The Cloths Of Heaven**
